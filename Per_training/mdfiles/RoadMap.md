Guiding Principles for this Plan:
Consistency is Key: Dedicate 1-2 hours on weekdays and 3-4 hours on weekends. This is non-negotiable.

Learn by Doing: Theory is useless without practice. Every concept must be implemented in code.

Build in Public: Create a GitHub profile and commit code daily. This becomes your proof of work.

Sample Weekly Routine (During Learning Phases)
Day	Task
Monday	Learn a new concept (e.g., Feign Client). Watch tutorials.
Tuesday	Implement the concept in a small practice project.
Wednesday	Debug and refine the code. Read documentation.
Thursday	Start integrating the concept into your main portfolio project.
Friday	Continue integration and write tests.
Saturday	LeetCode Practice (3-4 problems) and review the week's learning.
Sunday	Work on deploying a service to AWS/Cloud.
You have a solid foundation. This plan is designed to build upon it with the most in-demand skills. Follow this relentlessly, and you will be in an extremely strong position to negotiate a 10+ LPA offer in 8 months. Good luck! You can do this.

can make for 20 lpa preperation then i can atleast get 10 to 14
Of course. That's an excellent mindset. Aim for 20 LPA, and you'll confidently land in the 10-14 LPA range. This shifts your preparation from "meeting the requirements" to "becoming an exceptional candidate."

This enhanced roadmap is for a 20 LPA target. At ~2 years of experience, this requires demonstrating depth, architectural understanding, and skills beyond your years of experience.

The 20 LPA Candidate Profile (for 2 YOE)
Companies pay this for developers who show:

Mastery of Fundamentals: Exceptional problem-solving (DSA) and system design skills.

Production-Grade Mindset: Knowledge of testing, monitoring, CI/CD, and cloud design.

Ability to Handle Scale: Understanding of performance, caching, and distributed systems complexities.

Initiative & Impact: Demonstrated through a complex, well-architected, and deployed portfolio project.

The Intense 8-Month Roadmap to 20 LPA
Month 1: Java Virtuosity & Algorithmic Thinking
Goal: Java isn't just a language; it's your tool. Wield it masterfully.

Action:

Java 17+: Master not just features, but the why. Records, Sealed Classes, new GCs (ZGC, Shenandoah).

Concurrency Deep Dive: CompletableFuture for non-blocking calls, ForkJoinPool, ReentrantLock, Atomic classes. Understand the Java Memory Model (JMM).

JVM Internals (Basics): ClassLoaders, Garbage Collection algorithms, JVM flags (-Xms, -Xmx), how to profile a simple app.

LeetCode: 1 problem daily. Focus on writing efficient, production-quality code, not just solving it.

Month 2: Spring Boot - Beyond the Basics
Goal: Understand the magic behind Spring. Don't just use it, master it.

Action:

How Spring Works: Understand the Application Context, Bean lifecycle, @Conditional annotations, AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming).

Customizations: Write custom @Annotation, create a BeanPostProcessor, configure a custom HealthIndicator.

Testing: JUnit 5 with Mockito. Aim for >80% test coverage on all your projects. Learn @MockBean, @DataJpaTest, @WebMvcTest.

LeetCode: Ramp up to 2-3 problems on weekends. Start a notebook for patterns.

Month 3: Microservices Architecture & Design Patterns
Goal: Build not just services, but a robust, resilient system.

Action:

Communication:

Synchronous: Master OpenFeign with custom encoders/decoders and error handling.

Asynchronous: Kafka is mandatory. Understand consumer groups, partitions, exactly-once delivery, schema evolution with Avro.

Resilience Patterns: Implement Circuit Breaker, Retry, Bulkhead, Rate Limiter using Resilience4j. Understand the scenarios for each.

Distributed Tracing: Implement Sleuth + Zipkin. Log aggregation is key (e.g., with the ELK stack or Grafana Loki).

Month 4: Database Mastery & Performance
Goal: Data is the heart of the system. Design it for scale.

Action:

SQL (PostgreSQL): Advanced topics: Indexing (B-Tree, GIN, GiST), Query Optimization (EXPLAIN ANALYZE), Connection Pooling (HikariCP), Transactions isolation levels.

NoSQL: MongoDB (data modeling, aggregation pipeline) and Redis (not just caching, but Redis as a data structure server for leaderboards, session storage).

CQRS Pattern: Implement a simple read/write separation pattern in your project. This is a huge talking point.

Month 5: Cloud-Native Development & DevOps Lite (The Game Changer)
Goal: Show you can build and deploy software the modern way.

Action:

Docker: Write optimized, multi-stage Dockerfiles to create small, secure images.

Kubernetes (K8s) - Basics: This is what separates 10 LPA from 20 LPA. Understand Pods, Deployments, Services, Ingress. Deploy your project to a local Minikube cluster.

AWS/GCP/Azure: Pick one. For AWS: EC2, ECR, EKS (managed Kubernetes), RDS, ElastiCache (Redis), S3. Deploy your project using EKS.

CI/CD Pipeline: Build a basic GitHub Actions pipeline to: 1) Test your code on push, 2) Build a Docker image, 3) Push it to ECR.

Month 6: The "20 LPA" Portfolio Project
Goal: Build a system that screams "I am a senior engineer."

Action:

Project Idea: "Real-time Analytics Dashboard" or "Distributed Notification System".

Architecture: 5-6 microservices.

Tech Stack Must Include:

Spring Boot, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

Kubernetes (on AWS EKS or GCP GKE).

CI/CD via GitHub Actions/GitLab CI.

Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana for custom metrics (e.g., track API latency, error rates).

Frontend (Optional but impressive): A simple React/Vue.js dashboard to display data from your API.

Month 7: Advanced DSA & System Design
Goal: Ace the coding and design rounds.

Action:

DSA: Grind LeetCode. Target: 50+ Easy, 100+ Medium, 20+ Hard problems. Focus on problem patterns (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, BFS/DFS, Dynamic Programming).

System Design: Practice designing systems you use: YouTube, Uber, Swiggy/Zomato, Netflix.

Learn: How to calculate rough capacity estimation (QPS, storage).

Draw: Diagrams on Excalidraw or Miro. Discuss trade-offs (SQL vs. NoSQL, consistency vs. availability).

Mention: How you'd use caching (Redis), messaging (Kafka), and scaling (K8s) in your design.

Month 8: Interview Mastery & Negotiation
Goal: Convert your skills into a life-changing offer.

Action:

Behavioral Prep: Prepare deep stories. Use the STAR method. Have answers for: "Most challenging bug," "Disagreement with a manager," "How do you learn new tech?"

Resume: Your resume should be a highlight reel of your project. Use metrics: "Improved API response time by 60% using Redis caching," "Reduced cloud costs by 20% by optimizing Docker images."

Mock Interviews: Give at least 5-10 mocks with friends or on platforms like Pramp.

Negotiation:

Do NOT disclose current CTC. Simply say, "I am seeking compensation aligned with the market rate for my skills, which is in the range of 18-22 LPA."

When asked, say: "My current focus is on finding the right challenging role. I'm sure we can agree on a number that reflects the value I bring once we determine it's a mutual fit."

Get multiple offers. This is your biggest leverage.

By following this intense plan, you won't just be another candidate; you'll be the candidate who understands how to build, deploy, and scale robust systems. This depth of knowledge is exactly what commands a 20 LPA package, and it will make a 10-14 LPA offer a comfortable fallback. You can do this.
